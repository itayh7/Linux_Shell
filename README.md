# Linux_Shell
The goal of this project is to create a custom Unix-like shell from scratch, that supports essential shell features. The shell will provide a command-line interface where users can interact with the operating system, run various commands, and manage processes.
This project was made in "Extended System Programming Laboratory" course at Ben Gurion University.

## Usage
Run the command "make" and run the executable file "myshell"

## Implemented Features
'cd': Change the current working directory.
'exit': Terminate the shell and exit the program.
'history': Retrieve previously executed command lines.
'>', '<': I/O Redirection.
'|': Enable executing commands in sequence using pipes.

Process Manager Commands:
'procs': List running processes.
'wake <process_id>': Wake up a sleeping process.
'suspend <process_id>': Suspend a running process.
'kill <process_id>': Terminate a running/sleeping process.
